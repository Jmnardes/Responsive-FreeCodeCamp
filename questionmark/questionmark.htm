                <h3 id="headline">Here's some history of the question mark:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>8th century</strong> - Lynne Truss attributes an early form of
                             the modern question mark in western language to Alcuin of York.[2] 
                             Truss describes the punctus interrogativus of the late 8th century as, 
                             "a lightning flash, striking from right to left".</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Still 8th century</strong> - This earliest question mark was a decoration of one 
                            of these dots, with the "lightning flash" perhaps meant to denote intonation, 
                            and perhaps associated with early musical notation like neumes. Another possibility 
                            is that it was originally a tilde or titlo, as in ~, one of many wavy or more or 
                            less slanted marks used in medieval texts for denoting things such as abbreviations, 
                            which would later become various diacritics or ligatures.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>9th, 10th and 11th century</strong> - Over the next three centuries this pitch-defining element 
                            (if it ever existed) seems to have been forgotten, so that the Alcuinesque 
                            stroke-over-dot sign (with the stroke sometimes slightly curved) is often seen 
                            indifferently at the end of clauses, whether they embody a question or not.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>13th century</strong> - In the early 13th century, when the growth of 
                            communities of scholars (universities) in Paris and other major cities led to 
                            an expansion and streamlining of the book-production trade, punctuation was 
                            rationalized by assigning Alcuin's stroke-over-dot specifically to interrogatives; 
                            by this time the stroke was more sharply curved and can easily be recognized as 
                            the modern question mark.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Middle Ages</strong> - It has also been suggested that the glyph derives 
                            from the Latin quaesti≈ç meaning "question", which was abbreviated during the Middle 
                            Ages to qo. The lowercase q was written above the lowercase o, and this mark was 
                            transformed into the modern symbol.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>2011</strong> - Discovery by Chip Coakley, a Cambridge University manuscript 
                            expert, Syriac was the first language to use a punctuation mark to indicate an 
                            interrogative sentence. The Syriac question mark, known as the zagwa elaya ("upper pair") 
                            has the form of a vertical double dot over a word.
